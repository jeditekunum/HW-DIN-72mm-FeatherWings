# HW-DIN-72mm-FeatherWings
Original FeatherWings Extended for 72mm DIN Carrier

Edges stretched to 72mm.

**WARNING**

**Be aware that DIN carriers have ~2mm of unusable space around the edges. 72mm size have 68mm exposed space. The same holds true for the other dimension; the end caps also have 2mm each of unusable space. These PCBs have no extra space in that dimension. When ordering carriers they should be at least 4mm more than these PCBs. For example, the SingleWing is 22.86mm; the carrier should be at least 26.86mm.**
